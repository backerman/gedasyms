# Brad Ackerman's gEDA symbols

This is a repository with whatever symbols and footprints I've needed to
create.  Comments/suggestions/etc welcome to brad@facefault.org.

License: WTFPL version 2.  Google it if you haven't seen the acronym before.
(Summary: do whatever you want with these symbols.)
